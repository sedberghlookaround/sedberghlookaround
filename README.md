# How to use

###New Editions
Upload new editions to './issues'
Name should in the following format

197 February 2003.pdf
{Edition Number} {Month} {Year}.pdf

N.B
The last four characters must be the year.  It is this which lets the site group the in year blocks.

The image used to create a link to the latest edition is found at the following location  './img/current-edition.jpg' Simply replace it to when you upload a new edition.

###Text
The text is largely inside the layout elements.  It should ideally be drawn from datafiles and posts.  However, for now suggest text changes to someone happy to edit html.

###Team

Team members and info are in '_config.yml'

Images are in '/img/team/'
