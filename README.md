# How to use

### New Editions
#### PDFs
Upload new editions to './issues'
Name should in the following format

    197 February 2003.pdf
    {Edition Number} {Month} {Year}.pdf

N.B
The last four characters must be the year.  It is this which lets the site group the in year blocks.

PDFs should be optimised for the web.  I recommend [this site.](https://www.wecompress.com/en/)

#### Images
The image used to create a link to the latest edition is found at the following location  './img/current-edition.jpg' Simply replace it to when you upload a new edition.

### Copy
The text is largely inside the layout elements.  It should ideally be drawn from datafiles and posts. However, for now suggest text changes to someone happy to edit html.

### Team

Team members and info are in '_config.yml'.
Images are in '/img/team/'.
